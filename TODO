# TODO file for My WOD Log
#  Created by: Matthew Dalrymple
#  Last Updated: Saturday, 16 April 2011

MAJOR:
[x] Fix "Timer" switch so that it works (not sure how to test)
[x] Change Edit Controller to have custom notification name
[x] Add functionality to select method of user input to the Edit Controller[X] Add Notes to database
[ ] Add rep rounds to CreateWOD page (list view)
[ ] Add # of rounds field
[X] Add WOD Type field instead of switch
[ ] Add in intermediate database for exercises 
[ ] Error check Create WOD page
 -Must enter in a name, and add at least 1 exercise
[ ] Update Display WOD Page to reflect new Create WOD page


MINOR:
[ ] Make a Edit/View List page that is generic like EditViewController but
    is for viewing/editing a generic list
[ ] Change Edit Controller to pass in what the default text should be
 -This will allow someone to type in something, then come back and edit
  before they save (i.e. Type in name, click save, then click name and
  change it.  Even more useful with notes! [longer text])

BUGS:
[ ] WOD List -> View WOD Page will crash if WOD doesn't have any exercises
