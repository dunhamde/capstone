# TODO file for My WOD Log
#  Created by: Matthew Dalrymple
#  Last Updated: Tuesday, 3 May 2011

MAJOR:
[ ] Load in default data on start
[x] Fix "Timer" switch so that it works (not sure how to test)
[x] Change Edit Controller to have custom notification name
[x] Add functionality to select method of user input to the Edit Controller[X] Add Notes to database
[X] Add rep rounds to CreateWOD page (list view)
[X] Add # of rounds field and time limit field
[X] Add WOD Type field instead of switch
[X] Add in intermediate database for exercises 
[-] Error check Create WOD page (half done, could be more)
 -Must enter in a name, and add at least 1 exercise
[X] Update Display WOD Page to reflect new Create WOD page

MINOR:
[ ] Change ListEditVC to take a style option, make the other style
 have an Add button as one of the elements in the list (like Exercises on
 the create wood page)
[-] Make a Edit/View List page that is generic like EditViewController but
    is for viewing/editing a generic list
[X] Change Edit Controller to pass in what the default text should be
 -This will allow someone to type in something, then come back and edit
  before they save (i.e. Type in name, click save, then click name and
  change it.  Even more useful with notes! [longer text])
[ ] Refactor #define's to enums
 - See: UITextAlignment
[ ] Modify EditVC to not allow you to save with no input
[X] Check/Confirm to see that if a Mode is deleted, that all of the
    exercises in that mode also are removed


BUGS:
[ ] Crashes when you delete an exercise that is in use by a WOD!
  - This is because I set the rule to deny instead of nullify when an
    exercise is deleted and a eexercise has a reference to it.
  - We either need to figure out if there is a try/catch/exception thrown
    situation for this, or do some sort of software check on delete
[ ] Deleteing a WOD possibly doesn't remove eexercise's, rround's, and
    score's... investigate this
  - I set the rule to cascade, but it has not been tested to see if it
    actually works as expected.
[X] WOD List -> View WOD Page will crash if WOD doesn't have any exercises
[ ] User adds an exercise to a WOD then adds another, but removes the first
    exercise from the list (database).  The WOD is still on the create WOD
    page.
[X] Investigate what happens when a WOD has an exercise that has been deleted.
