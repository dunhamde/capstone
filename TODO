#  Created by: Matthew Dalrymple

# [ ] -- Needs to be done
# [-] -- Half finished/needs work
# [X] -- Completed

WEEKEND PLANS:
[X] Get exporting working -M/D
[ ] Get View WOD Page working with rep rounds -M
[ ] Merge itermediate score page with main page -D
[ ] Log Score Page redo with table view -M/D
[X] Don't allow save with no input on wod name (any)
LOWER PRIORITY WEEEKEND PLANS:
[X] Sentence case all inputted data / viewing wods
[X] Make sure all data put into database is either ALL CAPS or lower case

MAJOR:
[X] Fix add exercises to accomidate WODs like 'Nicole'
[ ] Create WOD Page: On WOD Type change remove all Exercises
[ ] Create WOD Page: Don't allow Add Exercise if no WOD Type
[ ] Create WOD Page: Delete Exercise on select and confirm
[-] Load in default data on start
[x] Fix "Timer" switch so that it works (not sure how to test)
[x] Change Edit Controller to have custom notification name
[x] Add functionality to select method of user input to the Edit Controller
[X] Add Notes to database
[X] Add rep rounds to CreateWOD page (list view)
[X] Add # of rounds field and time limit field
[X] Add WOD Type field instead of switch
[X] Add in intermediate database for exercises 
[-] Error check Create WOD page (half done, could be more)
 -Must enter in a name, and add at least 1 exercise
[X] Update Display WOD Page to reflect new Create WOD page

MINOR:
[ ] Add a 'view scores for this wod' button on a WOD's page
[ ] Add Alert to Add Exercise page to confirm the user adds a pound symbol
    '#' (or other symbol we want to use) to the exercise name to replace with
    the metric when added to a WOD
[ ] Make a Settings page (that shows up in iOS Settings app, not our app)
 - Put an about page for now
[ ] Change ListEditVC to take a style option, make the other style
 have an Add button as one of the elements in the list (like Exercises on
 the create wood page)
[-] Make a Edit/View List page that is generic like EditViewController but
    is for viewing/editing a generic list
[X] Change Edit Controller to pass in what the default text should be
 -This will allow someone to type in something, then come back and edit
  before they save (i.e. Type in name, click save, then click name and
  change it.  Even more useful with notes! [longer text])
[ ] Refactor #define's to enums
 - See: UITextAlignment
[X] Modify EditVC to not allow you to save with no input
[X] Check/Confirm to see that if a Mode is deleted, that all of the
    exercises in that mode also are removed


BUGS:
[ ] Crashes when you delete an exercise that is in use by a WOD!
  - This is because I set the rule to deny instead of nullify when an
    exercise is deleted and a eexercise has a reference to it.
  - We either need to figure out if there is a try/catch/exception thrown
    situation for this, or do some sort of software check on delete
[ ] Deleteing a WOD possibly doesn't remove eexercise's, rround's, and
    score's... investigate this
  - I set the rule to cascade, but it has not been tested to see if it
    actually works as expected.
[X] WOD List -> View WOD Page will crash if WOD doesn't have any exercises
[ ] User adds an exercise to a WOD then adds another, but removes the first
    exercise from the list (database).  The WOD is still on the create WOD
    page.
[X] Investigate what happens when a WOD has an exercise that has been deleted.
